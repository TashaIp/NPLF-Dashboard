# NPLF-Dashboard

  For our project at VandyHacks 2020 - Summer Edition, our team was matched with the Nashville Public Library Foundation (NPLF), a non-profit which aims to advance the impact of Nashville Public Library programs and initiatives. Our task was to create a user-friendly dashboard for NPLF marketing and communications staff in order to organize and analyze key marketing metrics related to the Foundation's online presence. This includes Google searches, visits to their website, and activity on their social media platforms. 
  To accomplish this task, our team created a Flask web application that displayed data visualizations using the Plotly Python library. We imported hard-coded data from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets into our Python application and used this data to create our visualizations. Our submission to VandyHacks includes six graphs using individual data from various online platforms (activity from Google, Facebook, Emails, etc) as well as a graph summarizing all of these finding in one central display.
